/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how your firstIndexOf() method in BinarySearchDeluxe.java
 *  finds the first index of a key that equals the search key.
 *****************************************************************************/
It uses binary search to find a key in the list that equals the search key and compares the key with an index directly before that key. If they are equal (the one before is a match) until it finds a key where the one before is not a match. 
/******************************************************************************
 *  What is the order of growth of the number of compares (in the
 *  worst case) that each of the operations in the Autocomplete
 *  data type make, as a function of the number of terms N and the
 *  number of matching terms M?
 *
 *  Recall that with order-of-growth notation, you should discard
 *  leading coefficients and lower order terms, e.g., M^2 + M log N.
 *****************************************************************************/

  When working on the project we noticed that the project checklist encouraged us to use Array.sort so we originally wrote our project like so, and then realized that the blackboard instructions contradicted that so we had to go back and change our code.
